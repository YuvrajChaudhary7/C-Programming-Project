# C-Programming-Project
The Media Library Management System is a simple C program that stores and manages media items using arrays and structures. It allows users to add, edit, delete, display, and search media, and supports batch import from a CSV file. The project demonstrates basic C concepts such as file handling, string operations, and menu-driven program design.
